# Week 2 â€“ BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

## My Notes - Summary of BabySoC Fundamentals

### ðŸ”¹ What is SoC?

* A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** = complete computing system packed inside a single chip.
* Combines **CPU + Memory + Peripherals + Interconnect**.
* Advantage â†’ smaller, faster, consumes less power compared to separate components.
* Examples â†’ processors inside smartphones, IoT devices, embedded boards.

### ðŸ”¹ Components of a Typical SoC

1. **CPU (Core)** â†’ executes instructions, brain of the chip.
2. **Memory** â†’ program + data storage (SRAM/DRAM/Flash).
3. **Peripherals** â†’ UART, GPIO, timers etc. for external communication.
4. **Interconnect/Bus** â†’ backbone for CPU â†” Memory â†” Peripherals communication.

# ðŸ”Ž Introduction to VSDBabySoC  

**VSDBabySoC** is a small yet powerful **RISC-V based SoC**, designed as a simplified platform to explore and test SoC concepts.  
Its primary goal is to:  
- Integrate and validate **three open-source IP cores** together for the first time.  
- Provide a platform to **calibrate and interact with analog parts** of the design.  

### ðŸ§© Components of VSDBabySoC  
1. **RVMYTH Microprocessor**  
   - A simple RISC-V based CPU introduced in a workshop by **RedwoodEDA** and **VSD**.  
   - Built in just **5 days** by students (even middle-schoolers!) using **TL-Verilog (TLV)** for rapid development.  
   - Ongoing contributions are open-source, encouraging community-driven development.  

2. **8x PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)**  
   - A control system that generates a stable output clock signal, phase-locked to the input reference clock.  
   - Essential for **clock generation and synchronization** within the SoC.  

3. **10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)**  
   - Converts **digital signals â†’ analog signals**.  
   - Widely used in communication systems for generating transmission signals.  
   - Enables VSDBabySoC to interface with external **analog devices**.

### ðŸ”¹ Why BabySoCis a simplified model for learning SoC concepts?

* Itâ€™s a **learning-friendly version** of SoC.
* Has **minimal blocks** (small CPU, simple memory, basic I/O).
* Helps me:

  * Understand **block-level interactions** clearly.
  * Trace **data flow** without too much complexity.
  * Build a strong **foundation before diving into real SoCs**.

### ðŸ”¹ Functional Modelling â€“ Role in Design Flow

* Comes **before RTL and Physical Design**.
* Purpose:

  * Check **basic functionality** of the SoC.
  * Validate that CPU, memory, and peripherals interact as expected.
  * Find design-level mistakes early (cheaper to fix now than later).
* Tools:

  * **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** â†’ simulate the Verilog code.
  * **GTKWave** â†’ visualize waveforms, debug signal transitions.

Basically â†’ **functional model = reference blueprint** before jumping into actual RTL implementation.

## âœ… Key Takeaways

* SoC = CPU + Memory + Peripherals + Interconnect â†’ all in 1 chip.
* BabySoC is a **minimal learning SoC**, easy to simulate & debug.
* Functional modelling = **first step** in SoC design flow.
* Tools: **iverilog + GTKWave** = simulate + view waveforms.
* BabySoC learning prepares me for **real SoC RTL + VLSI flow**.
