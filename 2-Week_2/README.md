# Week 2 â€“ BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

## My Notes

### ðŸ”¹ What is SoC?

* A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** = complete computing system packed inside a single chip.
* Combines **CPU + Memory + Peripherals + Interconnect**.
* Advantage â†’ smaller, faster, consumes less power compared to separate components.
* Examples â†’ processors inside smartphones, IoT devices, embedded boards.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Components of a Typical SoC

1. **CPU (Core)** â†’ executes instructions, brain of the chip.
2. **Memory** â†’ program + data storage (SRAM/DRAM/Flash).
3. **Peripherals** â†’ UART, GPIO, timers etc. for external communication.
4. **Interconnect/Bus** â†’ backbone for CPU â†” Memory â†” Peripherals communication.

### ðŸ”¹ Why BabySoC?

* Itâ€™s a **learning-friendly version** of SoC.
* Has **minimal blocks** (small CPU, simple memory, basic I/O).
* Helps me:

  * Understand **block-level interactions** clearly.
  * Trace **data flow** without too much complexity.
  * Build a strong **foundation before diving into real SoCs**.

So, BabySoC is like the **training wheels** for SoC design ðŸš².

### ðŸ”¹ Functional Modelling â€“ Role in Design Flow

* Comes **before RTL and Physical Design**.
* Purpose:

  * Check **basic functionality** of the SoC.
  * Validate that CPU, memory, and peripherals interact as expected.
  * Find design-level mistakes early (cheaper to fix now than later).
* Tools:

  * **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** â†’ simulate the Verilog code.
  * **GTKWave** â†’ visualize waveforms, debug signal transitions.

Basically â†’ **functional model = reference blueprint** before jumping into actual RTL implementation.

### ðŸ”¹ SoC Design Flow (big picture)

1. **Functional Modelling** â†’ BabySoC stage, check high-level behavior.
2. **RTL Design** â†’ describe actual logic in Verilog/VHDL.
3. **Synthesis** â†’ convert RTL to gate-level netlist.
4. **Physical Design** â†’ layout, placement, routing â†’ chip ready for fabrication.

BabySoC = Step 1 â†’ gives me clarity & confidence before deeper RTL work.

## Quick Block View (BabySoC Idea)

```
   +---------+       +---------+       +------------+
   |  CPU    | <---> | Memory  | <---> | Peripherals|
   +---------+       +---------+       +------------+
          \__________________  __________________/
                           |  Interconnect/Bus  |
                           +--------------------+
```

## âœ… Key Takeaways

* SoC = CPU + Memory + Peripherals + Interconnect â†’ all in 1 chip.
* BabySoC is a **minimal learning SoC**, easy to simulate & debug.
* Functional modelling = **first step** in SoC design flow.
* Tools: **iverilog + GTKWave** = simulate + view waveforms.
* BabySoC learning prepares me for **real SoC RTL + VLSI flow**.
