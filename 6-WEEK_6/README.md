# 🧩 Week 6 Task – Physical Design Workshop

## 🎯 Objective

To perform **hands-on Physical Design labs** using a pre-configured **VDI image** and understand the **complete hierarchy** of digital and mixed-signal design implementation — from **standard cell design** to **DRC** and **STA validation**.

---

## 💡 Why This Task Is Important

Having completed **OpenROAD installation** and basic **Floorplanning/Placement**, you are now ready to explore **end-to-end Physical Design**.

This workshop bridges the gap between **theoretical understanding** and **real-world chip implementation**, helping you gain insight into:

* 🔹 Integration of **hierarchical digital design** with custom analog/mixed-signal blocks
* 🔹 The interplay between **layout**, **timing**, and **design rule checks (DRC)**
* 🔹 How **physical design choices** affect sign-off quality and **silicon reliability**

By the end of this week, you will understand how **synthesis, STA, and layout** interact to transform a design from **RTL to physical silicon**.
