# Getting Started with Digital VLSI SOC Design and Planning

The process of Silicon proven chip design consists of following process:
# SoC Design Flow Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Understand the step-by-step workflow of designing a System-on-Chip (SoC), from specification to tapeout.
Run an application on the tapeout chip

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Stages

### **O1. Chip Modelling**

* Start with **specifications** written in **C model**.
* Testbench is developed in **C language** to validate functionality.

### **O2. RTL Architecture**

* Translate specs into a **soft copy of hardware** using RTL (Verilog).
* Processor + Peripherals/IPs modeled in RTL.
* Verification loop: Specs â†” RTL checked with C testbench.

### **O3. SoC Integration**

* Components integrated:

  * Gate-level netlist (from synthesis)
  * Macros (synthesized RTL)
  * Analog IPs (functional RTL or hardened macros)
* Integration includes **GPIOs and interface handling**.

### **O4. Final Chip Implementation**

* Floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), and routing performed.
* GDSII generated â†’ passes through **DRC/LVS checks** before tapeout.
* Final chip can be deployed in applications like **wearables, Arduino boards, TVs, AC controllers** etc.

## ðŸ”¹ Observations

* **Testbench in C** ensures consistency from specs to final chip.
* **Iteration between O1â€“O3** improves accuracy before fabrication.
* Design flow scales across domains â€” consumer electronics, IoT, and embedded systems.
