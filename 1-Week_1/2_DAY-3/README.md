# DAY 3: Combinational and Sequential Optimizations

## 1. Introduction to Optimizations

### SKY130RTL D3SK1 L1 – Introduction to Optimizations Part 1

* **Combinational logic optimization**: The process of squeezing logic to achieve an optimized design in terms of **area** and **power**.
* **Techniques for combinational optimization**:

  * **Constant propagation**: A direct optimization technique where constant values are propagated to simplify logic.
  * **Boolean logic optimization**: Using methods like **K-map** and **Quine–McCluskey** for simplification.

### SKY130RTL D3SK1 L2 – Introduction to Optimizations Part 2

* **Sequential logic optimization**:

  * **Basic techniques**: Sequential constant propagation.
  * **Advanced techniques**:

    * State optimization
    * Retiming
    * Sequential logic cloning (floorplan-aware synthesis)

### SKY130RTL D3SK1 L3 – Introduction to Optimizations Part 3

* Consolidates both **combinational** and **sequential** optimization concepts.

## 3. Sequential Logic Optimizations

* **SKY130RTL D3SK3 L1 – Lab07 Sequential Logic Optimisations Part 1**
* **SKY130RTL D3SK3 L2 – Lab07 Sequential Logic Optimisations Part 2**
* **SKY130RTL D3SK3 L3 – Lab07 Sequential Logic Optimisations Part 3**

These labs demonstrate sequential optimizations, starting from constant propagation and moving toward advanced techniques like **retiming** and **cloning**.

## 4. Sequential Optimizations for Unused Outputs

* **SKY130RTL D3SK4 L1 – Seq Optimisation Unused Outputs Part 1**
* **SKY130RTL D3SK4 L2 – Seq Optimisation Unused Outputs Part 2**

Focuses on optimizing designs by removing or simplifying **unused sequential outputs**, thereby reducing unnecessary resource usage in the synthesized design.
