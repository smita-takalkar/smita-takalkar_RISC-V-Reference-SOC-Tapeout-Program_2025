# DAY 2 
## PLOTTING Id vs Vds

```bash
vim day2_nfet_idvds_L015_W039.spice
```

**Explanation:**

This command opens the **Vim text editor** to create or modify a SPICE netlist file named
`day2_nfet_idvds_L015_W039.spice`.

The file name encodes important device parameters:

* **`day2`** â†’ Indicates this is part of the *second-day exercise* or simulation.
* **`nfet`** â†’ Refers to the NMOS transistor type.
* **`idvds`** â†’ Represents the **Iâ€“V characteristic simulation** (Drain current vs Drain voltage).
* **`L015_W039`** â†’ Specifies **channel length (L = 0.15 Âµm)** and **width (W = 0.39 Âµm)**.
  These are **short-channel dimensions**, used to study advanced behavior such as velocity saturation or channel length modulation.

### ðŸ§  **Purpose of this Step**

This netlist is used to simulate **drain characteristics** of a smaller geometry NMOS transistor under the **Sky130 1.8V process**.

### âš¡ **Run NMOS Simulation in Ngspice**

```bash
ngspice day2_nfet_idvds_L015_W039.spice
```

**Explanation:**
This command runs the **Ngspice simulator** on the SPICE netlist file you created â€”
`day2_nfet_idvds_L015_W039.spice`.

When executed, Ngspice will:

1. **Parse the netlist** to identify all circuit elements (transistor, voltage sources, models, etc.).
2. **Load the Sky130 PDK model** files specified using `.include` (for example, `all.spice`).
3. **Perform the analysis** defined in the file â€” in this case, a **DC sweep** of the drain voltage (`Vds`) while keeping the gate voltage (`Vgs`) constant.
4. **Output simulation data** such as drain current (`Id`) vs. drain voltage (`Vds`).

In Ngspice,
```
plot -vdd#branch
```

plots the **current flowing through the voltage source named `Vdd`**.

* The **negative sign (-)** is used because Ngspice defines current **entering the positive terminal** of the voltage source as positive.
* To get the **drain current (Id)** (flowing *out* of the transistor into Vdd), you invert the sign â€” hence `-vdd#branch`.

So, this plot represents **Id vs. Vds (drain current vs. drain voltage)** for the NMOS transistor.
The lower values showing quadratic behavior nad higher values showing liner behavior

## PLOTTING Id vs Vgs

ðŸ“Š Observation

Since the channel length is 0.15 Âµm (short-channel device), the Id vs Vgs graph exhibits a linear behavior instead of the ideal quadratic relation seen in long-channel MOSFETs.
