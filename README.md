# RISC-V Reference SOC Tapeout Program 2025â€” My Learning Journey

ðŸ“˜ Overview <br /> 
This repository documents my journey as a participant in a RISC-V SoC Tapeout Workshop, where I work through week-wise tasks to learn the complete chip design flow.

**Whatâ€™s inside:**

* Weekly lab summaries with objectives, steps, and key observations

* Notes explaining important concepts and design decisions

* Scripts, logs, and outputs from RTL â†’ synthesis â†’ place-and-route â†’ GDSII

* Personal takeaways highlighting lessons learned at each stage

Iâ€™m building this as both a structured learning journal and a portfolio to showcase my growth in SoC design, RISC-V, and open-source hardware flows.
