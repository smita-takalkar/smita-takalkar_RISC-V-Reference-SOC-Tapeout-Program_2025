# 🧭 Week 5 Task – OpenROAD Flow Setup and Floorplan + Placement  

### 🎯 **Objective**
To set up the **OpenROAD Flow Scripts** environment and execute the **Floorplan** and **Placement** stages of the physical design flow.

This task marks the transition from **SPICE-level transistor design (Week 4)** to **backend implementation**, where logic is physically realized on silicon.

## 🌟 Why This Task Is Important
After analyzing timing at the transistor level, it’s crucial to understand **how real circuits are placed on the chip**.  
This task introduces **OpenROAD**, a leading open-source **RTL-to-GDSII** toolchain used in both academia and industry.

### By completing this task, you’ll learn:
- 🧩 How **design constraints** (like core utilization and aspect ratio) are applied before routing.  
- 🧱 How **standard cells** are placed efficiently to reduce **delay**, **area**, and **routing congestion**.  
- ⚙️ How **physical design choices** impact timing, power, and manufacturability.  

This is my **first hands-on step** into **Physical Design Automation** — the bridge between digital logic and real silicon.

## ⚙️ Task Steps Overview
1. **Set up the OpenROAD Flow Scripts environment**  
   - Install necessary dependencies and tools.  
   - Verify installation using the provided test design.

2. **Run the Floorplanning Stage**  
   - Define chip area, core utilization, and power distribution.  
   - Visualize placement boundaries using OpenROAD GUI (optional).

3. **Execute the Placement Stage**  
   - Perform **global** and **detailed placement**.  
   - Analyze timing and congestion reports generated by OpenROAD.

Would you like me to make a **version with screenshots placeholders and command examples** (e.g., how to run `make floorplan` and `make placement`)? That would make it even more practical and ready for GitHub documentation.
